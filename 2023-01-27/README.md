The notes & assigned homework are [here](https://uncloak.org/courses/rust+cryptography+engineering/course-2023-01-27+Session+9+Notes).

## Assigned reading

* [x] Most of chapter 13 may be skipped, though 13.5.6 on replay attacks is worth covering.
* [x] Chapter 14 on key negotiation explores a protocol to obtain a secret session key from an existing secret shared key, for forward secrecy
* [x] It's worth a light read of chapter 15 & 16. 

## Homework related to protocol building

* [x] **TLS 1.3 implements session resumption, allowing previously connected parties to re-use a previously used shared secret key. Does the session resumption protocol obtain forward secrecy? (Not answered in the book, use the internet).**

Looking around on the internet, the following links are useful to understand session resumption:
* [TLS Session Resumption: Full-speed and Secure](https://blog.cloudflare.com/tls-session-resumption-full-speed-and-secure/) (Cloudflare Blog)
* Search for "0-RTT resumption" in [A Detailed Look at RFC 8446 (a.k.a. TLS 1.3)](https://blog.cloudflare.com/rfc-8446-aka-tls-1-3/) (Cloudflare blog)

Now, what is forward secrecy exactly? It's the ability to protect past session, even if the long-term secrets are compromised in the future. From that point of view, the resumption protocol achieves forward secrecy: past sessions, including sessions that have resumed using the protocol, are secure against a compromise of the long-term server or client keys.

* [x] **List the checks performed in the protocol in chapter 14 on page 235. Could this protocol be vulnerable to a Man-in-the-Middle attack?**

Here's the protocol from the book:
![final_protocol](./cryptography_engineering_final_protocol.png)

The checks performed are:
* Bob verifies `s < 2*sb`
* **Alice checks AuthB**
* Alice checks `sa -1 <= log2(p) <= 2*sa`
* Alice checks `255 <= log2(q) <= 256`
* Alice checks (p, q) are prime
* Alice checks q is a divisor of (p-1)
* Alice checks g != 1 and g^q == 1
* Alice checks X != 1 and X^q == 1
* **Bob checks AuthA**
* Bob checks Y != 1 and Y^q == 1

In this protocol, the only relevant checks to prevent Man-in-the-Middle attacks are "Auth" checks (bolded). From page 230 ("An Authentication Convention"):

> In our protocols, every time a party sends an authentication, the authentication data consists of all the data exchanged so far: all the previous messages, and all the data fields that precede the authentication in the authenticatorâ€™s message. The authenticator will also cover (be computed over) the identities of the communicants.

This means `AuthB` contains Alice's identity, Bob's identity, s<sub>a</sub>, N<sub>a</sub>, (p, q, g), and X. Similarly, `AuthA` contains Bob's identity, Alice's identity,  s<sub>a</sub>, N<sub>a</sub>, (p, q, g), X, and Y.

This thwarts any risk of Man-in-the-Middle attacks assuming Alice and Bob can successfully authenticate their public keys in the first place.

* [x] **Using the internet, find at least one method used for nonce-generation, besides a counter. Describe this method for nonce generation in the Discord study-group-main-channel chat.**

Methods to generate nonces:
* Large random number: this is useful for secret nonces used in e.g. ECDSA signatures. Good randomness needed!
* UUIDs using PRNG or true CSPRNGs: good for DB identifiers, request IDs, etc
* Current timestamp in nanoseconds: has the advantage of being monotonic and unique
* Current Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana block hash: has the advantage of providing global, decentralized agreement (similar to using a timestamp). The added bonus is unpredictability. This is useful for protocol which need proof of liveness, i.e. prove that you know X as of block Y.
