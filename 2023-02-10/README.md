## Homework related to Chapter 2

* [ ] **Compute with pen and paper, the ElGamal algorithm for Alice sending Bob a message. Use parameters: p=19, g=2, a=3, b=5, m=12. You may choose any k. If an adversary obtained the computed ciphertext (c<sub>1</sub>, c<sub>2</sub>), and obtained access to k, how could they decrypt the ciphertext?**

* [ ] **Compute with Shank's algorithm, on pen and paper, the discrete log of 2<sup>x</sup> = 33**

* [ ] **Optional: Implement one or both of ElGamal encryption and/or shank's algorithm.**
