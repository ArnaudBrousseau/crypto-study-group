The notes & assigned homework are [here](https://uncloak.org/courses/rust+cryptography+engineering/course-2023-02-24+Session+13+Notes).

## Assigned reading

* [ ] Sections 5.1 through 5.5 (basic facts about elliptic curves)
* [ ] Section 5.8 on bilinear pairings

## Homework

* [ ] **Migrate [this toy elliptic curve](https://github.com/cjeudy/EllipticCurves) implementation to Rust. Then review the [Rust Crypto elliptic-curves library](https://github.com/RustCrypto/elliptic-curves). What techniques could you use to improve your implementation?**
